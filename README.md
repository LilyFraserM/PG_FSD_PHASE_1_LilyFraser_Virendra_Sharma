PG FSD Phase-1 Project
LockedMe.com App

Project Goals:
The project had to enable a user to register and login to the LockedMe.com App. 

The user must be able to choose the following options: 

The first option should return the current file names in ascending order. The root directory can be either empty or contain few files or folders in it.
The second option should return the details of the user interface such as options displaying the following:
1. Add a file to the existing directory list
2. Delete a user specified file from the existing directory list
    and return a message if FNF (File not found).
3. Search a user specified file from the main directory
4. Option to navigate back to the main context
There should be a third option to close the application.
